## Explain the technical problem that you solved in this exercise

This week we tackled three different approaches for Franck-Condon Factors (FCF) calculations. In the first task, we approximated the physical system, a H2 molecule, by using the harmonic oscillator. It allowed us to calculate Franck-Condon Factors (FCF) with a sufficient approximation. One of the main disadvantages of this method is that it can not be applied on the polyatomic systems where we have to take mode mixing into account. In the second part of the assignment we introduced the approach that allows us to calculate FCFs for polyatomic molecules. In order to implement the overlap of the possible states, we introduced the Duschinsky matrix. Finally, in the third part of the assignments, we verified that it’s possible to program a device that can run Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) and, therefore, can be used to calculate the FCFs. Using GBS sampling we’re also able to reconstruct the vibronic spectrum of a molecule. All the simulations we ran are supported by experiments. 


## Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve

Quantum computers are naturally suited to simulating chemical systems, where processes and interactions on the atomic level are governed by quantum mechanics. One use-case for photonic devices is to study how materials absorb light at different frequencies. These absorption spectra can be useful for tasks such as <b>solar cell optimization or in pharmaceuticals</b>. The main advantage of the chemical systems simulations is that they can be potential substitutes for experiments that are slow and very demanding regarding details.
