## Motivation

In this part, we entroduced pros and cons of codes licensed for the public domain and those that are licensed for private use.

## Pros of public domain

There are many advantages to using open source/public domain software/code:

* <b>No/minimal rewriting</b> -You donâ€™t have to re-write the code that is publicly available from scratch and it can be used as a base/pattern for private use.

* <b>Updates</b> - Whenever a new algorithm is introduced that might, for example, improve performance, you can use it to improve you private code. 

* <b>No switching/trial costs</b> - Sometimes there are many different programs that apply to what you are trying to achieve - with open source you can try them all and pick the one that is best for you at no cost. 

* <b>Crowdsourced customer service</b> - The popular open source projects are maintained by several contributors, so you are not dependent on a single company or a single person for updates. There may also be a quality benefit here if you believe that multiple contributors translates into better quality code. 
* <b>Documentation</b> - Since the open source community has incentives for bringing more developers into the community, they generally provide documentation and tutorials that are higher quality. 

## Cons of public domain

Dispite the greate variety of advantages, there are some disadvantages of the open source:

* <b>Security</b> - Security is cited as a major drawback. Since anyone can analyze open source code hackers can find vulnerabilities and use this knowledge to carry out cyber attacks. Hackers can alter open source code in a way that introduces new vulnerabilities. Supporters of open source, however, would counter with the fact that security bugs can also be reported/fixed by the open source community. 

* <b>Customer service</b> - if you open source your code you may be responsible for responding to the community who will have questions, report bugs, and offer suggestions.

* <b>Lack of control over talent</b> - The contributors to the open source might be professionals with poor experience in the area and, thus, introduce code errors or decrease performance of the code/algorithm.

## Private domain

Private domain is essentially the opposite of the advantages/disadvantages of public domain. You will have access to code, but you may be locked into one supplier, and the switching costs for trying something else may be high. You will also be dependent on one company, group of people, or one person for support, upgrades, etc. The code could be more secure and therefore you would be more protected from hackers, but you may also be dependent on the fact that the company has followed security best practices in creating their programs. You can minimize this risk by asking these companies for their security certificates and any other security testing that they have conducted.
